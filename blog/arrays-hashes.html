    <h1>Arrays vs. Hashes</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/ruby.png" alt="#">
      <p>
        This week, my cohort and I took our first foray into a back-end programming language, ruby! Ruby is a fairly high-level language, meaning it reads closer to English than low-level coding languages. This makes it easier to understand, and perhaps a good starting point for a coding novice.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, this week we'll be looking into two types of objects in ruby: arrays and hashes. Let's start with the most basic question, "What are these two things?"
      </p>
      <h3>What is an array?</h3>
      <p>This is an array:</p>
      <code>my_array = [7, 20, "Ken", "leopard gecko", true]</code>
      <p>
        Perhaps you can tell by looking, but an array is simply a <em>list of objects</em>. The list can be as long or as short as you want. My array above holds five objects. An array can also contain anything you want: integers, strings, booleans, or even other arrays. So you could make an array inside of an array inside of an array! It all gets very meta. One key property of arrays to note is that the position, or sequence, of items is important. But more on that in a bit. First, let's talk about hashes.
      </p>
      <h3>What is a hash?</h3>
      <p>A hash looks something like this:</p>
      <pre><code>
        my_hash = {
          month: 7,
          day: 20,
          name: "Ken",
          type: "leopard gecko",
          silly?: true
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Look familiar? Perhaps my strange list of objects in <code>my_array</code> makes a bit more sense now. Like an array, a hash is a list. But where an array is just a simple list, a hash is a <em>list of key-value pairs</em>. In my hash, I've marked the keys as categories (month, name, etc.) and the values as attributes of my pet (7, "Ken", etc.). A hash will connnect a value to a key and allow you to access the value using that key. Again, the keys and values can be any kind of object your heart desires. I have chosen to use an object in ruby called a <em>symbol</em> for my keys. A ruby symbol (written as either <code>:symbol</code> or <code>symbol:</code>) is somewhat like a string that ruby can process faster than other objects. This makes it a great choice for keys, especially when your hash gets long and ornery.
      </p>
      <h3>So, what's the difference between an array and a hash?</h3>
      <p>
        As we've noted, both arrays and hashes are essentially lists of information. They do very similar things, but the difference is in how you access them.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I mentioned above, the order of items in your array is important. That's because the way to access certain elements is to call their spot in the array. Each spot in the array is associated with a number value, or index. The index starts at 0 and goes up by one for each element in the array. So our array from before would have five index spots: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. For example, if I wanted to know what object was in the first index spot, I'd use
      </p>
      <code>my_array[0]</code>
      <p>and ruby would return</p>
      <code>> 7</code>
      <p>
        since that's the first item in <code>my_array</code>. For the second object, I'd write <code>my_array[1]</code>, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike an array, a hash does not particularly care about the order of objects. This is because to find a value in a hash, you'd call the key it's connected to. So let's say I wanted to know the name of my pet. With an array, it would be pretty difficult to find that information unless you knew exactly where it was in the list. But with a hash, I can simply write
      </p>
      <code>my_hash[name:]</code>
      <p>and I'll get</p>
      <code>> Ken</code>
      <p>
        which is the value connected to <code>name:</code> in <code>my_hash</code>. Pretty great, eh? Hashes are like arrays with the added benefit of being able to associate objects with key words, not just an index number. Nevertheless, both arrays and hashes have their advantages and disadvantages when programming.
      </p>
      <h3>When to use an array vs. a hash</h3>
      <p>
        Since an array is simpler than a hash, it's best used for any kind of basic list. Let's say you wanted to write a program that searched through the Lord of the Rings books, found every instance of the string "Ent", and pushed the page and line number into a list. An array would make much more sense for this sort of project. You could push the information into a hash, but your keys would probably end up looking like <code>instance_1:</code>, <code>instance_2:</code>, etc. If the keys in your hash would just be a glorified number index, you're probably better off with an array.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when you want something a little more robust than a simple list, hashes really shine. So now that you've found your page and line numbers, you want to write a short description of each Ent that appears in the book and put it in a list for future prosperity. Your description of Quickbeam is going to be awfully difficult to find if you have to memorize what index number it falls under. But if you were to put your descriptions into a hash, you could easily mark each one with a key, say <code>quickbeam:</code>. So if finding the value you want by index number is going to be extremely difficult, you're probably better of using a hash.

      <p>Thanks for reading. I'll be back next week.</p>
