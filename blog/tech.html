      My cohort and I are quickly coming upon the final week of our off-site training for Dev Bootcamp. It's been a quick 8 weeks, and I feel like I've learned quite a bit about programming in that time. Still, I know I've barely scratched the surface, so this week I'm going to look into something new: Rails!
    </p>
    <h3>What is Ruby on Rails?</h3>
    <p>
      Ruby on Rails, commonly referred to as simpley 'Rails', is a web application development framework. Technically, it is a package library (in this case, a RubyGem) that can be installed via command line and used to make web apps. It's based in Ruby, and uses a lot of the same syntax for data structures, such as arrays, hashes, iterators, etc. That said, the application programming interface (API), or commands used in the code, are different from normal Ruby. That's because the function of Rails is web development, and the things you want to do for web development are not necessarily the same as for a general-purpose programming language like Ruby.
    </p>
    <h3>What does Rails do?</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of Rails is to make web apps. Any given website is going to be made up of 3 basic parts: HTML for the content, CSS for formatting, and JavaScript for interactivity, etc. When your browser displays a page, it looks for information from these languages to figure out how the page should look, and what it should do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauty of Rails is that you can create all three of these files at once. Rails is, in its simplest form, a programming language used to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for a website. Coding in Rails is like coding in all these languages by proxy. Naturally, this can save a lot of time.
    </p>
    <h3>Why use Rails?</h3>
    <p>
      So we know Rails can save a lot of time, but what else does it have to offer?
    </p>
    <p>
      One aspect that makes Rails a popular development language these days is its design philosophy. All Rails apps follow a consistent form and flow, which makes them great for team projects. Anyone who knows Rails could look at another Rails project and understand how it works. Rails has a strong set of conventions, which is not always the case for other languages. This has made it popular with a lot of developers, especially the "cool kids", which has in turn only increased its popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong adherence to convention comes from the intention of the original creator, Heinemeier Hansson. Hansson has famously called Rails an <em>omakase</em> language. <em>Omakase</em> is a Japanese phrase meaning "I'll leave it to you." What it means is that Hansson has made a lot of decisions about how Rails works, based on his experience as a web developer. That means less decisions and things for us to worry about as individual developers; rather, we can just follow the guidelines set out by Hansson, which are generally lauded as quite good.
    </p>
    <h3>Why not use Rails?</h3>
    <p>
      All that said, Rails is not without its critics, and there are a number of well-grounded critiques of the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is that Rails is that Rails does too much work under the hood. One of the most satisfying aspects of code is that a skilled programmer who knows what to look for should be able to look at any code and understand how it works and why it works the way it does. Rails, on the other hand, has some built in functionality that cannot be found in a configuration file. For example, if you have a class <code>Person</code>, it won't be readily obvious that Rails has gone ahead and made a datatable named <code>people</code> to store instances of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another point is that while Rails is an <em>omakase</em> language, there is some wiggle room. Skilled developers can, and do, make substitutions and changes to match their own preferences. While this freedom can be good, it can also be confusing for beginners reading blogs and example code which don't follow the guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Rails looks like an exciting framework, and I can't wait to learn it. Thanks for reading, all.
