<!--
	-How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
		It was definitely different from making one alone. It was nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of, and it's certainly easier to be innovative when two people are working on it.
	-Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
		Yes, I did. Pure html does not give you a very good idea of what the site is going to look like. Therefore, the wireframe is an important step in imagining what the final product is going to look like.
	-What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
		We decided that a good wireframe should be clean and simple, showing the important elements of the page. It should include the navigation bar, different sections, and footer. 
	-What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
		We learned about the difference between <article> and <section>. <article> is used to define a stand-alone piece of content. Without any other context, you could read what's in the <article> tag and understand the article. <section> is more general; it's used to divide your page into different... well, sections. You can have <article>s in a section, or <section>s of an article.
