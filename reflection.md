    <li><h3>What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?</h3></li>
      <p>
        I learned a lot about how to manipulate these various spaces to get my page to look how I wanted it to. For example, I found that padding is an excellent tool to make buttons. Borders are good for dividing up your page. Also, putting a 1px red border around an element is a good way to easily see how much space its taking up. Margins are very important for spacing your page out and keeping it from getting crowded. I suppose you could use relative positioning for all your elements and force them to be spaced, but that would be an incredible hassle.

    <li><h3>What did you learn about CSS positioning?</h3></li>
      <p>
        I feel like a learned a lot about CSS positioning in the 3.4 challenge, and got to apply that knowledge here. Having a clear understanding of the different types of positions (ie, relative, absolute, etc.) was important for getting my page to look how I wanted it to. Also, I found that floating and clearing elements is the best way to get them to sit beside another element. I used this when setting pictures into a paragraph of text, for example. Finally, I did use display positioning (block, inline-block, etc.), but I feel that they didn't do what I expected them to do. I'll have to research more on what the display properties actually do.

    <li><h3>What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?</h3></li>
      <p>
        Very little was easy to implement this time around. I suppose the background color, font style and font color were easy to implement since I could just apply them to the whole body. After that, I had some trouble with nearly everything I tried to do. The hardest thing to get right was positioning. Sometimes I was just stumped for half an hour on positioning an item properly. For example, getting my social media buttons to sit stacked on the right of my "About Me" text turned out to be very difficult. I did eventually figure out how to do it by floating them right and making them into a list.

    <li><h3>What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?</h3></li>
      <p>
        My basic plan going into this was to follow the atomic model, where you make a bunch of classes, each with only 1 property. Then, you simply add those classes to the html to format it. However, I found that this method was really difficult for the kind of formatting I was intending to do. So I decided instead to give each section a class and format the sub-elements in that section separately. This helped me divide up my page in the CSS file and keep track of what I was changing. I tried to avoid formatting with ids because I heard from one of the videos that its conventional to format using classes these days.
